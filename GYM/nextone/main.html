                    <h2 >Elbow-Planks</h2>
                    <h3 >what are Elbow Plank ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">An elbow plank is an isometric core stability exercise, where you hold a position comparable to a push-up for as long as you can.
                        The key move involves raising yourself up onto your toes and forearms, with your elbows directly under your shoulders.

                    <br> Move your arms out to your sides and then back to an upright position, forming a straight line. Try to keep the rest of your body in this straight position for as long as you can.
                        </p>
                        <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                        <p class="word">
                            <br><h4>Strengthen all of your core muscles</h4> 
                             Planks and plank variations, unlike crunches, engage all the core muscles. The rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis and obliques are all included. These exercises also work the hips, back and shoulders muscles.
                            
                            <br><h4>Increase the level of stability </h4> 
                             Everyday activities such as bending over to pick something up require a strong and steady core.
                             To perform movements like swinging a baseball bat or striking a golf ball down the green, athletes rely on a firm core. Elbow Planks can help you tone your core while also improving your stability and balance.
                            
                            <br><h4> Help in reducing back pain</h4> 
                            
                             Core strength can help in correct spinal alignment and reduce the likelihood of lower back pain and injury.
                             If you already have back discomfort, planks can be beneficial. Before attempting the plank challenge, though, see your physician if you have any existing back problems or injury.
                            
                            <h4>Increase your endurance </h4> 
                             Your body will gain endurance by increasing the amount of time you hold your plank each day. Endurance is vital for boosting physical stamina as well as muscle strength and conditioning.
                            
                            However, the elbow plank challenge alone will not give you a six-pack.
                        </p>
                        <h3>how to do ?</h3>
                        <p  class="word">
                            Find a position where your body is straight and can span the entire length of the mat. Planks using either your palms or forearms are both excellent exercises.
    
                        
                            <br>• Begin in a plank position, with your forearms and toes facing down on the floor.</br> 
                             <br> • Your elbows are just under your shoulders, and your forearms are facing forward.</br>
                             <br> • Keep your head relaxed, and stare down at the floor.</br>
                             <br>  • Engage your abdominal muscles to draw your navel close to your spine.</br>
                             <br> • Keep your body stiff and upright, keeping a straight line from your ears to your toes with no bending or drooping.</br>
                             <br> • The spine should be in this posture to be in a neutral position.</br>
                             <br> • Check to see if your shoulders are drooping toward your ears.</br>
                             <br>  • The height of your heels should be higher than the height of your toes. For a total of ten seconds, stay in this position. </br>

                        <p class="word">Flutter kicks are an exercise that works the muscles of your core, specifically the lower rectus abdominal muscles, plus the hip flexors. They mimic a swimming stroke, but are performed on dry land. You can perform them lying on your back, or, if you want to also strengthen your back muscles, you can do them lying on your stomach.
                            </p>
                            <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>

                                Abdominal exercises, like flutter kicks, help strengthen the core muscles. Benefits of a strong core include:

                            <br> improved posture
                            <br> improved balance and stability
                            <br> more defined abdominal muscles
                            <br> increased ease while doing physical activities like swinging a golf club, reaching for something on a shelf, or tying your shoes
                            <br> helping you reach your fitness goals because a strong core is important for most physical activities
                            Flutter kicks may be a good alternative to other lower abdominal strengthening exercises such as boat pose, mountain climbers, and V-ups.

                            <p class="word">High Knees are a cardio-intensive exercise performed at a fast pace. It engages your core, strengthens all the muscles in your legs, gets your heart rate up and improves momentum, coordination and flexibility. Because of the many physical benefits, high-knees are incorporated into a wide variety of workouts. They’re also relatively easy exercises to perform because they can be practiced anywhere — no gym or equipment required.
                                </p>

                                    The explosive action of high knees gets your heart pumping for greater cardiovascular health while activating the quadriceps, calves, hamstrings, and glutes. It also juices the hips, abs, and upper body.

                                    <br> However, it’s also a plyometric exercise that improves your neuromuscular efficiency, which translates into improved acceleration, agility, and overall speed. You’re training your body in a specific movement pattern (running) but in a biomechanically correct way at functional speed. In short — you’re training your body to run better.

                                <h3>how to do ?</h3>
                                    <p class="word"> 
                                        <br>1. Start with your feet slightly apart, with your weight centered over the balls of your feet.
                                        <br>2. Lift your left knee as high as comfortably possible and bring the heel toward your glutes.
                                        <br>3. Drive your left knee and foot back toward the ground as you lift your right knee as high as possible and bring the right heel toward your glutes.
                                        <br>4. Drive your right knee back toward the ground as you lift your left knee as in step 3.
                                        <br>5. Be sure to pump your arms in normal running form. This will help you gather enough momentum to keep your knees high, even after you start getting winded.
                                        <br>6. Repeat for 10 seconds, slowly extending the time you do the exercise.

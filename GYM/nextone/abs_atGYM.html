            <h3 >what are Seated knee raise ?</h3>
            <p class="word">For the rehabilitation of patella-femoral pain syndrome. This exercise will reposition your knee cap so it goes into a better alignment when you walk or run. It is a grade 1 exercise. You will need to progress to more challenging exercises.
            </p>
                
               <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                <p class="word">
                    Seated knee tucks are a great exercise to target your abs and improve core strength. Asides from all the aesthetic benefits you can get, having a strong core also helps to protect your back from injury and can improve your posture tremendously. 
                 </p>
                <h3>How to Do ?</h3>
                <p class="word">
                   <br> In sitting, have a roll of towel between your knees and gently squeeze. 

                   <br>  Straighten your leg while maintaining the pressure on the towel roll. 

                   <br> Slowly bend your knee again and repeat.

                <h2 >2. Cable Crunches</h2>
                <h3 >what are Cable Crunches?</h3>
                <p class="word">Cable crunches, also known as kneeling cable crunches, are a weighted crunch variation that target your abdominal muscles. Perform cable crunch exercises by kneeling in front of a cable station with a pulley attachment. Grip the rope attachment with both hands and pull it down until it rests right above your head. While keeping your hips and arms still, squeeze your core muscles and bring your shoulders toward your pelvis. Lower your upper body until your elbows nearly touch your knees. Repeat this movement for the desired amount of repetitions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">
                       <br> 1. Cable crunches can enhance your core strength and stability. Cable crunches activate muscles throughout your upper abs and lower abs, including the rectus abdominis (the six-pack ab muscle). A strong core is essential for performing more challenging compound exercises like the deadlift, bench press, and pull-up.
                       <br> 2. Cable crunches are easily adjustable. Unlike other core exercises, like sit-ups, cable crunches allow you to keep your abdominal muscles under constant tension. Adjust the weight level according to your needs, gradually increasing your core strength.
                       <br> 3. Cable crunches can improve your posture. By activating your core, glutes, and lower back muscles, the cable crunch is a great exercise to practice if you want to correct improper posture in your upper body.
                    </p>
                    <h3>how to do ?</h3>

                       <br> 1.Kneel on the ground in front of a cable machine, holding one end of the rope in each hand around your face.
                       <br> 2.Exhale and bend your torso forward without moving your lower body.
                       <br> 3.Continue until you can no longer do so.
                       <br> 4.Inhale and allow your torso to be raised back up, returning to the starting position.

                    <h3 >what are Decline Situps  ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">A decline situp bench positions your upper body at an angle so that it's lower than your hips and thighs. This positioning causes your body to work harder, since you have to work against gravity and through a wider range of motion. Decline situps are an effective core exercise to add to your fitness routine
                        </p>
                        <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                        <p class="word">
                           <br> Decline situps increase spinal flexion and work the core muscles around the torso, thighs, and pelvis. These include the rectus abdominis, obliques, and rectus femoris.

                           <br> They also strengthen the back, chest, and hip flexors, which are the inner hip muscles that bring the abdomen toward the thighs as you lift.
                            
                           <br> The movement allows your hips, low back, and core to work together to improve balance, stability, and posture. All of these benefits help to reduce low back pain, prevent injury, and make all types of movements easier.

                        <h3 >what are Hanging Leg Raise?</h3>
                        <p class="word">The hanging leg raise is a high-level isolation exercise that helps build the hip flexors and abdominal muscles. All you need is access to a high bar and you can easily add this exercise to your advanced core workout.
                            </p>
                            <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                            <p class="word">
                               <br> Both primary hip flexors—the sartorius and the iliopsoas—work hard during hanging leg raises. The longest muscle in the body, the sartorius assists with hip and knee flexion. The iliopsoas flexes the hip to draw the thighs to the trunk, aids in side bending, and flexes the lumbar spine.1

                               <br> The rectus femoris, tensor fasciae latae, pectineus, and adductor longus are synergistic muscles that are also activated during the hanging leg raise. The stabilizing abdominal muscles during this exercise are the rectus abdominus and the obliques.
                                
                               <br> While the traditional crunch and its variants give a top-down approach to working the abs, the hanging leg raise is a bottom-up approach that works them in a different way than many other exercises.2 Advanced exercisers can use this movement to vary their ab routine.
                                
                               <br> The effects you get from this exercise depend on how far you are able to raise your legs—but you will feel your abdominals working hard at just about any level. A strong core makes it easier to lift heavy items while also supporting a healthy posture.
                        </p>

                            <h3>how to do ?</h3>
                                <p class="word"> 
                                    Grab the bar with an overhand grip, your thumbs wrapped around the bar to improve stability. You don't have to necessarily be hanging at this stage but, ideally, your hands should be grasping the bar well above your head.

                                   <br>1. Exhale as you lift your feet off the ground, raising your straight legs outward in front of you. Tilt your pelvis slightly back and engage your abdominals and hip flexors to assist with the movement.
                                   <br>2. Raise your legs to a level that feels challenging but still enables you to keep good form. Strive to get them parallel to the ground (so that your hips are bent at 90 degrees), or a little higher if you can.
                                   <br>3. Lower your legs back down slowly until they return to the starting position, inhaling during this portion of the exercise. Maintain your posterior pelvic tilt, even at the bottom of the movement.

                                       <br>2. Your knees must be bent and stacked together. For instance, your left knee must be on the floor and your right one must be stacked on top.

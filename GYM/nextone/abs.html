                <h2 >Side Plank</h2>
                <h3 >what are Side Plank ?</h3>
                <p class="word">The side plank is an excellent exercise for strengthening the oblique abdominal muscles, which don't get worked as much during ab exercises such as crunches.
						You will hold your body on your side in a straight position supported only by one arm and the side of one foot.
						
					<br>Strong obliques can be pretty useful as core stabilization muscles.
							Beginners must build the strength and balance needed with warmups for the obliques and modified side planks before progressing to the side plank. 
							You can include side planks in your core exercise routine, Pilates, or yoga practice.
					</br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">
                       <br> The primary muscles used are the obliques, along with the gluteus medius and gluteus maximus to stabilize the hips. 
							Your shoulder stabilizers keep you aligned as well.
                     <br> This exercise doesn't put pressure on your lower back or neck as many core exercises do. In pregnancy, the side plank is preferred as it places less stress on the center abdominal muscles.
                    <br> It is a balancing exercise and you will be building your balance and coordination. This exercise can help you be able to sustain good posture and ease of movement by building a strong core and better balance.

            <h2 >NARROW PUSH-UPS</h2>
            <h3 >what are Narrow Push-Ups ?</h3>
            <p class="word">Close-grip push-ups are a variation of the standard push-up that involve placing your hands narrower than shoulder-width apart. This calisthenics exercise works muscle groups throughout your entire body, including your deltoids, pecs, and triceps muscles.
    
                <br> Specifically, Narrow Push-Ups work on:
                
               <br> anterior deltoids in your shoulders
                <br> pectoral chest muscles (pectoralis major)
                <br> &gt; triceps muscles—specifically the triceps brachii
                
                
                Read on to learn more about the benefits of Narrow Push-Ups and how to incorporate them into your exercise routine.</p>
                <h3>What are the benefits of Narrow Push-Ups</h3>
                
                <p class="word">
                    <br><b>1.Improve Muscle Endurance:</b>As you work your arms and chest with this workout, your muscles can become stronger and as a result handle more and more pressure.
					<br><b>2.Improve Balance and Stability:</b> When done with proper form (and by using all three components of fitness: cardio, strength training, and flexibility), close grip push-ups will develop not only broad chest and arm strength but also your overall balance and stability. In addition, by training your body to do this exercise with ease, 
							you'll be developing a broad, solid set of muscles that help you get through daily activities like carrying groceries or walking up the stairs without feeling any discomfort.
					<br><b>3.Improved Mobility &gt; Flexibility:</b> If you want to increase muscle strength, your muscles must be mobile enough to do so. If you're not mobile, it will be tough for you to develop good form while doing close grip push-ups (plus lack of mobility can lead to injury). But if done correctly, these push-ups will help loosen up tight muscles in your chest, arms shoulders which may benefit some of your daily activities like working on the computer or driving.
					<br><b>4.Tone &gt; Tighten Arms, Shoulders &gt; Back:</b> Anyone who has done push-ups knows that they are one of the most effective exercises to make your arms toned and tight (in a good way).
                </p>
                <h3>How to Do ?</h3>
                <p >
                    <ul >
                        <li class="word"> 1. First, you need to come into the plank position with your wrists underneath your shoulders and your fingertips pointing forward. Check that your neck and back are both in a neutral position so that your core is engaged.</li>

                        <li class="word">2. Place both hands approximately two inches apart and bring in your elbows so that they are close to your ribs on both sides. Make sure your spine is not too low or too high but is in a perfectly neutral position. </li>
    
                        <li class="word"> 3. Next, lower yourself down toward the ground slowly by bending your elbows and allowing them to move outwards slightly. </li>
    
                        <li class="word">4. Slowly lift yourself back up into starting form while keeping your spine in the neutral position.</li>
                        <li class="word">5. After your first rep, depending on your experience you can do 2-3 sets of 8 to 10 reps each</li>
						<li class="word">6. If you are a beginner, it's more important to perfect your form first before increasing your reps as not to get injured or develop the incorrect form.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2 >DIAMOND PUSH-UPS</h2>
                <h3 >what are Diamond Push-ups ?</h3>
                <p class="word">Diamond push ups, also known as tricep push ups, are a variation of this classic bodyweight exercise. 
								Instead of having your hands far apart, you keep them next to one another (or very close) as you press your body up. 
								You position your hands in the shape of a diamond on the floor when doing this push up, hence the name diamond push ups.
								<br>Due to the biomechanics, this push up variation is among the most challenging ones. Unlike the classic push up where your chest (pecs) is the primary muscle group that works, your triceps do the bulk of the work here.<br>
								
								<br>Below, we have jotted down diamond push ups muscles worked:
								<br>Pectoralis major
								<br>Triceps
								<br>Deltoids
								<br>Rhomboid 
								<br>Trapezius
                    </p>
                    <h3>what are itS benefits ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">
                       <br><h4>1. Increased Tricep Activation :</h4>
                     <br>&nbsp; Due to the narrower position of the hands, more of the load is placed on the tricep. In fact, in a study by the American Council on Exercise (ACE), they found that the diamond push-up is the most effective tricep exercise, 
							followed by dips and tricep kickbacks. This makes them a top choice for people who want to strengthen their triceps or bring more definition to them.
                    <br><h4>2. Diamond push-ups work multiple muscle groups across your body :</h4>
                    <br> &nbsp; The diamond push-up is a compound exercise that provides a workout for both your upper body and lower body. With proper form, diamond push-ups activate chest muscles like the pectoralis major, shoulder muscles like the anterior deltoid, and leg muscles like the quadriceps.
                    <br><h4>3. Diamond push-ups increase core stability and strength :</h4>
                    <br> &nbsp; The diamond push-up activates the stabilizer muscles in your core, including the transverse abdominis. By increasing your core strength, diamond push-ups enhance your balance during everyday activities.
                    <br><h4> 4. Diamond push-ups are a good home workout :</h4>
                    <br> &nbsp; Similar to the regular push-up, the diamond push-up variation requires no equipment, making it an easy choice for an exercise routine outside of the gym.
                    </p>
                    <h3>how to do Diamond Push-Ups?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Equipment: no equipment required

                    <ol>
                        <li class="word">1. Begin on all fours with your knees and toes flexed and in contact with the floor. Your hips should be over your knees. Your hands should be slightly narrower than your shoulders. Connect your thumbs and index fingers to create a diamond shape. 
											Grip the ground with your hands, and rotate your shoulders outward to engage your lats..</li>
                        <li class="word">2. Straighten your legs to lift your knees off the ground so you end up in a pushup position. Your legs should be hip-width apart or together. </li>
                        <li class="word">3. Pretension your shoulders and hips while engaging your core. Squeeze your quads and glutes. Your chin should remain tucked, as if you were holding an egg under your chin. All repetitions should begin from this position.</li>
                        <li class="word">4.  Pull your chest toward your hands by bending your elbows. Your shoulder blades should retract as you lower to the ground .</li>

                    <h2 >BENCH DIPS</h2>
                    <h3 >what are Bench Dips ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">The answer is simple: an excellent exercise that you can learn in little to no time.
					<br>The bench dip strengthens major upper body muscle groups like the arms, chest, and shoulders.

                    <br> Upper body strength is vital to functional activities and  even more critical in sport-related performance. Without upper body strength, you are at risk of injury in your daily activities
                        </p>
                        <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                        <p class="word">
                            
                            <br> Dips strengthen the muscles in your chest, shoulders, triceps, upper back, and lower back.
                            
                          
                            
                            <br> When done correctly, bench dips can add muscle mass to your upper body. This exercise can also help build your strength for other exercises like bench presses.
                            
                            
                            <br> Dips are an excellent exercise to increase flexibility in the shoulders and wrists, as well as gaining muscle mass in the upper body.
                            
                            <br> Bench dips require a great deal of core muscle activation. This helps you to be balanced, stable and coordinated.
                            
                            <br>In addition, it’s an exercise that uses plenty of stabilizing muscles, which will result in a more developed upper body. With stronger joints and developed stabilizing muscles, you will be less susceptible to injury when doing other exercises.
                            
                            <br> Bench dips are the best exercises that you can do at home and Gym. These exercises can be done with items like stairs, chairs, or other sturdy raised surfaces.

                            Follow these form cues to learn how to do safer bench dips. Once you've read the step-by-step directions,then after perform it carefully .
    
                        <ol>
                            <li class="word">• Sit on the edge of a bench, with your arms extended and your hands on the bench. To start, keep your feet flat on the floor with your knees bent. As you progress, you can straighten your legs and rest your heels on the ground to ramp up the difficulty.</li> 

                             <li class="word"> • Importantly, your hands should be placed on the bench so that your hands are facing out away from yourself. If you keep your knuckles facing forward, you'll put your shoulders into an internally rotated position.</li>

                             <li class="word"> • Push up off the bench, which will help you to drive your shoulder blades down and create scapular depression. Squeeze your shoulder blades to create tension.</li>

                             <li class="word">  • Lower down with control to a depth that feels comfortable. You shouldn't lose tension in your mid-back. Your elbows should never exceed your shoulder height.</li>

                             <li class="word"> • Extend your elbows and squeeze your triceps hard to raise back up.</li>

                             <li class="word"> • Start with 3 sets of 8 to 10 controlled reps.</li>

                    <h3 >What is Bodyweight Triceps Extension ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">The bodyweight tricep extension is a deceptively effective muscle-building movement for growing your triceps.

                    <br> This is primarily because you’re lifting the same percentage of your body weight that you would during a push-up, except that your chest and shoulders are far less active because bodyweight tricep extensions are a single-joint exercise. As such, your triceps receive way more tension because they have to do more work.
                        </p>

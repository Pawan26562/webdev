            <h2>Biceps</h2>
            <div class="heading">
            <h2 >1. Barbell Curl</h2>
            <h3 >what are Barbell Curl ?</h3>
            <p class="word">it is essential to know what barbell bicep curl is. If you work out, chances are that you have heard about bicep curls. This is a weight training exercise that targets the muscles in your upper arm. It can be done using a variety of equipment such as a dumbbell or a resistance band. When performed with a barbell, the exercise is referred to as barbell curl. 

                <br> Also known as a barbell bicep curl, it is one of the most common yet effective exercises for building the upper body. 
                
               <br> A barbell curl exercise is a pull-type isolation exercise. It is a modifiable exercise with several variations.</p>
                
               <h3>what are the benefits of Barbell Curl ?</h3>
                <p class="word">
                    <br> 1. Barbell curls increase your upper-body strength. The barbell curl targets your biceps brachii muscle as well as the brachialis, a muscle responsible for elbow flexion. With regular practice, barbell curls can help you build bigger biceps. Barbell curls generally allow you to lift heavier weight than dumbbell curls.
                    <br> 2. Barbell curls improve your grip strength. By activating the brachioradialis muscle in your forearm, barbell curls can enhance your grip strength and improve your performance during other upper body exercises like deadlifts, bench presses, and pull-ups.
                    <br> 3. Barbell curls are a versatile bicep exercise: You can adjust the weight plates attached to the barbell to accommodate your fitness level. Remember to start with lighter weights at first until you’re comfortable with heavy weights.
                </p>
                <h3>How to Do ?</h3>
                <p class="word">
                    Now that you know how to do barbell curl, it’s time to perfect its moves. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to a barbell curl workout. This is the traditional standing barbell curl:
                    <br>
                    
                    <br>1. Stand straight with your core braced and chest open.
                    <br>2. Hold a barbell with both your hands using an underhand grip. The barbell must be held just outside your hips.
                    <br>3. Keep your chest up, tighten your elbows and raise your hands slowly while engaging your biceps.
                    <br>4.While maintaining a stretch on your biceps, bring up the barbell to your shoulder height. Squeeze your biceps here.
                    <br>5. Start lowering the bar while keeping your biceps engaged. 
                    <br>6. Aim to do 5-8 sets of 12-15 reps of the barbell curl exercise. 
                </p>

                <h2 >2. Dumbell Hammer curl</h2>
                <h3 >what are Dumbell hammer curl?</h3>
                <p class="word">The hammer curl, also known as the dumbbell hammer curl or the neutral grip dumbbell curl, is a strength training exercise that targets your biceps and forearms. The hammer curl varies from the traditional bicep curl by using a neutral grip with your palms facing each other during the full range of motion. With proper form, hammer curls can promote upper body stability and arm strength.
                    </p>
                    <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">
                        <br> 1. Hammer curls work multiple muscles in your arm. While the traditional bicep curl targets the short head of the biceps brachii, the hammer curl offers a more comprehensive arm exercise, activating the long head of the biceps brachii and the brachialis, or elbow flexor muscles. 
                        
                         <br> 2. Hammer curls develop your grip strength. By activating the brachioradialis muscle in your forearm, hammer curls improve your grip strength. Good grip strength is essential for managing compound exercises like pull-ups and deadlifts.
                        <br> 3. Hammer curls put less stress on your wrist. As opposed to traditional bicep curls, hammer curls keep your wrist in a neutral position throughout the movement, putting more emphasis on your forearm and less on your wrist.
                    </p>

                    <p class="word">The single-arm dumbbell preacher curl is an exercise that focuses on building the biceps, particularly the biceps peak. Most people will go light on this movement, performing it for moderate to high reps as part of an upper-body or arms-focused workout.
                        </p>

                           <br>1. Grab a dumbbell with the right arm and place the upper arm on top of the preacher bench or the incline <br>2. bench. The dumbbell should be held at shoulder length. This will be your starting position.
                           <br>3. As you breathe in, slowly lower the dumbbell until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched.
                           <br>4.  As you exhale, use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder height. Again, remember that to ensure full contraction you need to bring that small finger higher than the thumb.
                           <br>5.  Squeeze the biceps hard for a second at the contracted position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
                           <br>6.   Switch arms and repeat the movement.

                        <p class="word">Also known as a crucifix curl, the overhead cable curl is a biceps-focused exercise performed between two cable stacks, using a pair of D-handles. The arms and elbows are held at shoulder height throughout the movement, and both hands curl in toward the ears. This position is designed to eliminate shoulder involvement and momentum, while targeting the biceps peak. This movement is generally done for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or more, as part of arm-focused training.

                                   <br>1. To begin, set a weight that is comfortable on each side of the pulley machine. Note: Make sure that the amount of weight selected is the same on each side.
                                  <br>2.  Now adjust the height of the pulleys on each side and make sure that they are positioned at a height higher than that of your shoulders.
                                   <br>3. Stand in the middle of both sides and use an underhand grip (palms facing towards the ceiling)  to grab each handle. 
                                   Your arms should be fully extended and parallel to the floor with your feet positioned shoulder width apart from each other. Your body should be evenly aligned the handles. This is the starting position.
                                   <br>4. While exhaling, slowly squeeze the biceps on each side until your forearms and biceps touch.
                                   <br>5. While inhaling, move your forearms back to the starting position. Note: Your entire body is stationary during this exercise except for the forearms.
                                   <br>6.   Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions prescribed in your program.

                            <h3 >what are  barbell preacher curl?</h3>
                            <p class="word">It's best to use an EZ-bar for this exercise, though you can also use dumbbells or a barbell, and naturally make sure you're adept at the standard preacher curl before removing a digit from the equation. Set up as normal on the preacher bench, holding the bar in an overhand grip using just your fingers
                                </p>
                                <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                                <p class="word">
                                    The main benefit of the Preacher Curl is that it focuses on muscle growth for the biceps.

<br> This is because it places such a strong emphasis on the negative portion of every rep, where you lower the barbell to the starting position.

<br>A HUGE part of building muscle is linked with the negative portions of reps. This is because it allows you to maximise time under tension whilst slowly returning the load to the starting position.


<br>Another benefit here is that you can easily push harder when you are working to fatigue. Once you have destroyed your arms and do not have any power left to bring the weight up, you can simply get your workout buddy to help you with the first part of the lift then once again allow the weight to descend whilst trying to control it as slowly as possible.

                                        <br>3. Press your upper body against the pad and rest your arms on the frontal pad

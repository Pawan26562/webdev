            <h2 >1. Tricep Pushdown</h2>
            <h3 >what are Tricep Pushdown ?</h3>
            <p class="word">The tricep pushdown is considered one of the most effective isolation exercises for engaging your triceps and developing strength, size, and obtaining definition. <br>

              <br>  This in-depth guide details how to perform the tricep pushdown effectively, the muscles worked, the benefits, and some tricep pushdown variations and alternatives to build muscle mass and strength. <br>
                
               <br> If that wasn’t enough, we’ve also included some alternative tricep movements that will compliment the tricep pushdown, either as superset or as a variation within your training routine.</p>
                
               <h3>what are the benefits of Tricep Pushdown ?</h3>
                <p class="word">
                     <br> A rope pushdown workout is not just about getting chiselled triceps. It also offers the following benefits: 

                    <br> 1. It helps in stabilizing the shoulder joints.
                    <br> 2. It also adds more stability in elbows.
                    <br> 3. It improves the aesthetic appeal of your physique. 
                    <br> 4. The workout also engages abs and core muscles to make them stronger. 
                    <br> 5. It improves your overall strength and endurance. 
                    <br> 6. Your capacity to lift weights increases with time.
                    <br>  7.It is also good for building overall arm strength to perform daily tasks. 
                    <br> 8. It is a convenient exercise for beginners that can be performed at home with a resistance band as well. 
                                    </p>
                <h3>How to Do ?</h3>
                <p class="word">
                    <br>1. Attach the cable bar attachment to the cable or rope machine.
                    <br>2.Select a weight that you’re comfortable with lifting on the cable stack.
                    <br>3.Adjust the bar so that it is set to hang at chest level from the top pulley.
                    <br>4.Whilst facing the machine, take hold of the bar with an overhand grip - your palms should be facing the floor. 
                    <br>5.Have your feet hip-width apart, and your knees slightly bent. 
                    <br>6.Your elbows should be resting at a 90-degree angle.e.

                <h2 >2. overhead Triceps Extension</h2>
                <h3 >what are overhead Triceps Extension?</h3>
                <p class="word">A tricep extension is a movement in which the back of the arm is targeted for strength and hypertrophy through extension of the elbow. It can be done using one arm at a time or both arms simultaneously, and you can utilize dumbbells, a barbell, a resistance band, or a cable machine in order to complete the tricep extension. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">
                        1.Dumbbells are highly versatile: Because of their variability in size and weight, dumbbells are perfect for using just about anywhere, and by anyone! From those who are brand new to exercise, all the way to elite athletes, dumbbells are highly adaptable
                       <br> 2. Can aid in training imbalances: Although each and every body will have some sort of asymmetry somewhere (because let’s face it, none of us are perfect), dumbbells can help improve imbalances that have been noted. Got one side of the body stronger than the other? Dumbbells can help! Want to work on specific training variables, or recovering from a unilateral injury? Dumbbells can aid in focusing upon – as well as improving – stability and strength! 
                      <br>  3. User friendly: For an exercise such as the tricep extension, some might find that a dumbbell is much easier to maneuver than a barbell or cable machine handle…and this is true for several other exercises as well! Although barbells, med balls, and cable machines all have their place within the fitness world, dumbbells can definitely be a bit more user friendly when it comes to isolating smaller muscle groups like the triceps.
                      <br>  4. Greater load range: Dumbbells come in weights as low as 1lb and as heavy as 100+ lbs. The increments are also fairly small for the first 20-25lbs. With other equipment, you won't have such incremental changes and low weights to begin with. This makes it far easier to implement progressive overload, which is a crucial aspect of building muscle and strength in your triceps. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>how to do ?</h3>
                    <p class="word"> 
                    You can perform this exercise with one dumbbell cupped in both hands, so the palms face the ceiling or with a dumbbell held in each hand. Alternatively, you can use a resistance band by standing on one end and holding the other ends in your hands behind your back. <br>

                    <br> 1.Lift the dumbbell directly overhead. Ensure the head stays aligned over the chest, the core remains engaged, and the shoulders are relaxed.
                    <br> 2.Extend both arms fully, then exhale and slowly lower the weight, bringing the weight behind the head by bending at the elbows. Be sure the chest stays aligned over the hips and the back does not arch.
                    <br>3. Inhale and reverse the movement once you reach a 90-degree bend at the elbow or slightly further, lifting the weight back to the starting position. The weight should not touch the back of the head when it is in its lowest position.
                    </p>

                    <h3 >what are Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">The reverse-grip cable straight-bar push-down is a twist on the popular cable straight-bar push-down. The difference has to do with how the hands are positioned holding the bar: the palms facing up rather than down. Because grip will be a limiting factor, this movement is usually performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per set or higher.

                        <p  class="word">
                           <br>1. Start by setting a bar attachment (straight or e-z) on a high pulley machine.
                           <br> 2.Facing the bar attachment, grab it with the palms facing up (supinated grip) at shoulder width. Lower the bar by using your lats until your arms are fully extended by your sides. Tip: Elbows should be in by your sides and your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position.
                           <br>3. Slowly elevate the bar attachment up as you inhale so it is aligned with your chest. Only the forearms should move and the elbows/upper arms should be stationary by your side at all times.
                           <br>4. Then begin to lower the cable bar back down to the original staring position while exhaling and contracting the triceps hard.
                           <br> 5.Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

                        <h3 >what are Triceps Dips?</h3>
                        <p class="word">The triceps dip exercise is a great bodyweight exercise that builds arm and shoulder strength. This simple exercise can be done almost anywhere and has many variations to match your fitness level. Use it as part of an upper-body strength workout.
                            </p>
                            <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                            <p class="word">
                               <br> The triceps dip is one of the most effective exercises for activating the triceps brachii muscle in the back of your upper arm.1 Additionally, you must activate your core as you hold your hips off the ground.

                               <br> We use our triceps to extend our elbows.2 They're also used for pushing, so you engage them in any daily activities that require a pushing motion. This includes pushing a lawnmower or a shopping cart and other similar movements.
                                
                               <br> It's also important to keep your body in balance. So, if you participate in sports that use a lot of pulling actions (which involve the biceps), you need to maintain strength in your triceps to prevent muscle imbalances and injury.
                        </p>

                                    Sit on the edge of a stable chair, weight bench, or step and grip the edge next to your hips. Your fingers should be pointed at your feet, your legs extended, and your feet about hip-width apart, with the heels touching the ground. Look straight ahead with your chin up.

                                   <br>1. Press into your palms to lift your body and slide forward just far enough that your behind clears the edge of the chair.
                                   <br>2. Lower yourself until your elbows are bent between 45 and 90 degrees. Control the movement throughout the range of motion.
                                   <br>3. Push yourself back up slowly until your arms are almost straight, and repeat.

                            <p class="word">The triceps dip is a bodyweight exercise performed on parallel bars or on a pull-up and dip station. It targets the triceps first, but also stretches and strengthens the chest and shoulders. Dips with a triceps focus are usually performed with an upright torso, the knees bent and crossed, and the arms close to the body. Dips can be performed for low reps for strength or higher reps for muscle growth.
                                </p>

                                       <br>1 Stand between a set of parallel bars. Place a hand on each bar, and then take a small jump to help you get into the starting position with your arms locked out.
                                       <br>2. Begin by flexing the elbow, lowering your body until your arms break 90 degrees. Avoid swinging, and maintain good posture throughout the descent.
                                       <br>3. Reverse the motion by extending the elbow, pushing yourself back up into the starting position.

            <h2 >PULL-UPS</h2>
            <h2 >what are Pull-UpS</h2>
            <p class="word">A pull-up is an upper-body strength exercise. The pull-up is a closed-chain movement where the body is suspended by the hands, gripping a bar or other implement at a distance typically wider than shoulder-width, and pulled up. 
								As this happens, the elbows flex and the shoulders adduct and extend to bring the elbows to the torso
    
                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pull-ups build up several muscles of the upper body, including the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and biceps brachii. 
					A pull-up may be performed with overhand (pronated), underhand (supinated)—sometimes referred to as a chin-up—neutral, or rotating hand position.
                
                
                Read on to learn more about the benefits of Pull-up and how to incorporate them into your exercise routine.</p>
                
				<h2>What are the benefits of doing Pull-Ups ?</h2>
                
                <p class="word">
					<br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strengthen the back muscles</h3>
                    <br> The pullup is one of the most effective exercises for strengthening the back muscles. 
						Pullups work the following muscles of the back:
					<br><h4> •Latissimus dorsi:</h4> largest upper back muscle that runs from the mid-back to under the armpit and shoulder blade
					<br><h4> •Trapezius:</h4> located from your neck out to both shoulders
					<br><h4> •Thoracic erector spinae:</h4> the three muscles that run along your thoracic spine
					<br><h4> •Infraspinatus:</h4> assists with shoulder extension and is located on the shoulder blade
					
					<br><br><h3>Strengthen the arm and shoulder muscles</h3>
					<br> Pullups also strengthen the arm and shoulder muscles. By performing pullups regularly, you’ll work the forearms and shoulders. 
						If you’re looking to improve your strength in these areas, you should perform pullups regularly.
					<br> If you can’t perform the full pullup, doing them assisted or just getting in the position (hanging from the bar) can increase your strength as you work up to the complete movement.
					
					<br><h3>Improve grip strength</h3>
					<br> Pullups also help improve grip strength. Grip strength is important if you lift weights.
						It also can improve performance in many sports like golf, tennis, rock climbing, and bowling.
						
					<br><h3>Improve overall body strength and fitness level</h3>
					<br> Strength or resistance training can increase your overall fitness level. When you’re performing a pullup, you’re lifting your entire body mass with the movement.
						This can greatly improve your body strength and even improve your health.
					<br>  Studies show that strength training is important for promoting bone development and enhancing cardiovascular health.
					
					<br><h3>Improve mental health</h3>
					<br> Strength or resistance training is also beneficial for your mental health. 
						A review of studies found a positive correlation between strength training and the following:
					<br>  •reducing anxiety symptoms
                    <br>  •improving cognitive function
                    <br>  •reducing fatigue
                    <br>  •reducing depression
                    <br>  •improving self-esteem
                </p>

                <h2 >CHIN-UPS</h2>
                <h3 >what are Chin-Ups ?</h3>
                <p class="word">Despite being challenging, chin-ups are one of the most effective upper-body exercises you can add to your training.
							Chin-ups are a variation of Pull-Ups that work more on your biceps than they do on your forearms.
                    </p>
                    <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">
                       <br> The chin-up is a compound exercise that targets multiple muscles simultaneously, including the latissimus dorsi (lats) and rhomboids in your back, biceps, and forearms.
                     <br><br> When developed properly, these muscles can create the physical aesthetic of a narrower waist, broader back, and bigger arms — but the benefits aren’t just visual. 
							Strengthening these muscles can help you with everyday tasks, not just in the gym.
                    <br><br> As it’s a compound exercise, we recommend performing chin-ups early in your workout as it can be more challenging once fatigue has kicked in.
                    
                    </p>
                    <h3>how to do ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;All you need is a pull-up bar and your bodyweight…
                    <ol>
                        <li class="word">1. Grip the bar approximately shoulder width apart — with your palms facing towards you.</li>
                        <li class="word">2. Hang from the bar with your arms extended. Squeeze your shoulder blades together — this will ensure your lats and rhomboids are activated during the lift. </li>
                        <li class="word">3. Pull your body up, squeezing your shoulder blades and driving your elbows towards the hip — stop when they’re in line with your body or your chest touches the bar.</li>
                        <li class="word">4. Pause at the top, and reverse the movement by slowly lowering yourself back to the starting position — stay in control during the lowering phase.</li> 
                    </ol>
                    </p>

					<p>
					<br><h3>Variations of the chin-up and alternative exercises<h3>
					<br><b>1. Assisted chin-up:</b>
					<br>A chin-up can be quite challenging for beginners.
						You can progress towards full chin-ups using an assisted pull-up machine that is found in most gyms.
					<br>You can choose the amount of weight you want to assist you, meaning you’re lifting less than your bodyweight, which should make the exercise easier.
					<br>As you get stronger, you’ll be able to decrease the assisting weight, before eventually attempting the full chin-up.

                    <br><b>2. Negative chin-up:</b>
					<br>The negative chin-up involves only the lowering phase of the exercise, but it’s still a great way of building strength.
					<br>You can stand on a box or bench so that your chin is above the bar. Take your feet off the box and lower yourself until your arms are fully extended and your feet are touching the floor.  
						Then get back on the bench and start again.
					<br>This can help build strength over time to allow you to begin handling your own bodyweight more comfortably.

                    <br><b>3. Weighted chin-ups:</b>
					<br>Okay, so you’ve perfect the chin-up and want to make this more difficult — this means adding more weight.

                    <br>The easiest way to add weight to your chin-up is by using a dipping belt or simply holding a dumbbell between your feet. As you get stronger, you’ll be able to gradually increase the weight.

                    <h3 >What are Diamond Push-ups?</h3>
                    <p class="word">Diamond push-ups, often referred to as triangular or tricep push-ups, are a more sophisticated version of the traditional push-up. From the name itself, diamond push-ups are performed by positioning the hands in the shape of a diamond.

                    
                        </p>
                        <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                        <p class="word">
                            <br><h4>Strengthen all of your core muscles</h4> 

                            <br> Planks and plank variations, unlike crunches, engage all the core muscles. The rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis and obliques are all included. These exercises also work the hips, back and shoulders muscles.
                            
                            <br><h4>Increase the level of stability </h4> 
                            
                            <br> Everyday activities such as bending over to pick something up require a strong and steady core.
                            
                            <br> To perform movements like swinging a baseball bat or striking a golf ball down the green, athletes rely on a firm core. Elbow Planks can help you tone your core while also improving your stability and balance.
                            
                            <br><h4> Help in reducing back pain</h4> 
                            
                            <br> Core strength can help in correct spinal alignment and reduce the likelihood of lower back pain and injury.
                            
                            <br> If you already have back discomfort, planks can be beneficial. Before attempting the plank challenge, though, see your physician if you have any existing back problems or injury.
                            
                            <br><h4>Increase your endurance </h4> 
                            
                            <br> Your body will gain endurance by increasing the amount of time you hold your plank each day. Endurance is vital for boosting physical stamina as well as muscle strength and conditioning.
                            
                            However, the elbow plank challenge alone will not give you a six-pack.

                            <br> Your body will gain endurance by increasing the amount of time you hold your plank each day. Endurance is vital for boosting physical stamina as well as muscle strength and conditioning.
                            
                            However, the elbow plank challenge alone will not give you a six-pack.

                <h2 >Side Plank</h2>
                <h3 >what are Side Plank ?</h3>
                <p class="word">The side plank is an excellent exercise for strengthening the oblique abdominal muscles, which don't get worked as much during ab exercises such as crunches.
						You will hold your body on your side in a straight position supported only by one arm and the side of one foot.
						
					<br>Strong obliques can be pretty useful as core stabilization muscles.
							Beginners must build the strength and balance needed with warmups for the obliques and modified side planks before progressing to the side plank. 
							You can include side planks in your core exercise routine, Pilates, or yoga practice.
					</br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>what are the benefits ?</h3>
                    <p class="word">
                       <br> The primary muscles used are the obliques, along with the gluteus medius and gluteus maximus to stabilize the hips. 
							Your shoulder stabilizers keep you aligned as well.
                     <br> This exercise doesn't put pressure on your lower back or neck as many core exercises do. In pregnancy, the side plank is preferred as it places less stress on the center abdominal muscles.
                    <br> It is a balancing exercise and you will be building your balance and coordination. This exercise can help you be able to sustain good posture and ease of movement by building a strong core and better balance.
